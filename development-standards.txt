** Development standards **

Please endeavour to keep to these standards when maintaining and extending this project.

  * Eliminate duplication mercilessly. If you are repeatedly writing the same code, refactor so that the repeated code
    is separated out into one place.
  * Simplify mercilessly. If there is a simpler way to express something, refactor.
  * Developer all new code test-first.
  * Spring, JSP and web container configuration is tested by end-to-end tests in the src/test/web folder. These tests
    are slow (on the order of a second each) so only use them for testing things you can't test with unit tests.
  * Unit tests should be fast. As of writing the entire suite (102 tests) runs in 0.875 seconds. Keep to this standard.
  * Don't defer rework if it is in the path of changes that you need to make. Leave all the code that you touch clean.
  * If you see something that needs fixing or think of a better way of doing something and it's not in the path of
    the work you're doing: add it to to-do.txt.
  * Please do not commit any eclipse/netbeans/etc. metadata. To create an eclipse project use: mvn eclipse:eclipse
